## Styleguides

### Common Convencions

* Use tabs instead spaces (tab = 4 spaces)

### Git Commit Messages

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    >
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
* When only changing documentation, include `[ci skip]` in the commit message
* Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
    * :art: `:art:` when improving the format/structure of the code
    * :racehorse: `:racehorse:` when improving performance
    * :non-potable_water: `:non-potable_water:` when plugging memory leaks
    * :memo: `:memo:` when writing docs
    * :penguin: `:penguin:` when fixing something on Linux
    * :apple: `:apple:` when fixing something on macOS
    * :checkered_flag: `:checkered_flag:` when fixing something on Windows
    * :bug: `:bug:` when fixing a bug
    * :fire: `:fire:` when removing code or files
    * :green_heart: `:green_heart:` when fixing the CI build
    * :white_check_mark: `:white_check_mark:` when adding tests
    * :lock: `:lock:` when dealing with security
    * :arrow_up: `:arrow_up:` when upgrading dependencies
    * :arrow_down: `:arrow_down:` when downgrading dependencies
    * :shirt: `:shirt:` when removing linter warnings

### C++ Styleguide

Style is definied in [clang-format file](/.clang-format), so please just run `clang-format in root directory :) Style now should be fine.

In other cases please follow style form older peaces of code :)


Thanks
